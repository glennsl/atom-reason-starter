# reasonable-atom-starter

A very rough starter project for atom packages written in Reason and BuckleScript.

To get started:
```
git clone http://github.com/glennsl/reasonable-atom-starter.git
cd reasonable-atom-starter
npm install
npm start
```

`npm install` will put a symbolic link in your ~/.atom/packages. Open or relaod Atom to pick up your new package.
